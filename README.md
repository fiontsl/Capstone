Hereâ€™s how it works: 

![TDI Capstone Website](https://github.com/fiontsl/Capstone/assets/33294622/b2ab8776-a0fc-4357-a725-01f313c9f969)

How to reproduce the website:

1) If you are hosting this website on a cloud service, you will need to first create an account and run Ngrok:
    from pyngrok import ngrok 
    !ngrok config add-authtoken (your_token)

2) Install requirements.txt
    !pip install -r requirements.txt

3) You should also have a seperate config.json file to contain the keys. They should look like this:
   
   {
    "aws_access_key_id": "your_aws_access_key_id",
    "aws_secret_access_key": "your_aws_secret_access_key",
    "apiKey_spoonacular": "your_apiKey_spoonacular"
    }

4) Run streamlit_app.py 

5) To get a Ngrok Tunnel link to the website, run the following:

    import os
    !nohup streamlit run /content/streamlit_app.py --server.port 8501 &
    import time
    time.sleep(5) # Wait for Streamlit to start running
    from pyngrok import ngrok
    url = ngrok.connect(proto='http', addr='8501')
    print(url)

6) You should get an output that look like this:

    nohup: appending output to 'nohup.out'
    WARNING:pyngrok.process.ngrok:t=2023-06-02T22:43:51+0000 lvl=warn msg="ngrok config file found at legacy location, move to XDG location" xdg_path=/root/.config/ngrok/ngrok.yml legacy_path=/root/.ngrok2/ngrok.yml
    NgrokTunnel: "https://071d-34-86-164-136.ngrok-free.app" -> "http://localhost:8501"

7) To check you tunnels:
    tunnels = ngrok.get_tunnels()
